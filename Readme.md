# Mars Time
This simulation game gives you a chance to drive rover to explore Mars. That is based on two Mars rovers launched by NASA, Spirit and Opportunity, which landed on Mars in 2004. You could search for some valuable objects, such as sphere-like grains or "blueberries", regarded as the proof of water on Mars. You could get the news thread only if the rover contacts the objects. Then you could send these news to the earth, NASA will pay you back as a reward to support your further exploration.
